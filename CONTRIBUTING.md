## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

There are many ways in which you can contribute.  
 
We plan to accept community code contributions including new chart types, bug fixes, and additional features for existing chart types.   We're still working out the contribution guidelines. Hold tight, we'll update you here when we've formalized the guidelines.   
 
In the meantime, you can contribute to Power BI Visuals in a few different ways:
* Submit bugs by opening an Issue.
* Contribute to discussions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/powerbi).
* Follow the [Power BI Developer](http://blogs.msdn.com/powerbidev) blog for updates.

## Contributor License Agreement

You must sign a [Microsoft Contribution License Agreement (CLA)](http://cla2.dotnetfoundation.org) before your PR will be merged. This a one-time requirement for projects in the Microsoft. You can read more about [Contribution License Agreements (CLA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) on Wikipedia.

However, you don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual.

When your pull-request is created, it is classified by a CLA bot. If the change is trivial, i.e. you just fixed a typo, then the PR is labelled with `cla-not-required`. Otherwise it's classified as `cla-required`. In that case, the system will also tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you signed a CLA, the current and all future pull-requests will be labelled as `cla-signed`.

Signing the CLA might sound scary but it's actually super simple and can be done in less than a minute.
